### General information

**Vunki** is a client side application to learn languages using flashcards. Could you aks to yourself. Why should I need use this application when nowdays exists a lot of apps online to do the same task as this one.

At the first hand a few apps have a fixed number of flash cards to create besides offering deals to spent money to create more flashcards, thus this mean an extra spent in your budget. These services also have an outdated design, and the user sees an overwhelming interface seeking the desired options.

In the other you might think you can solve these troubles using a desktop app, but most of them are outdated or require install third-party libraries or virtual machines to run it with a cost of performance and disk space.

Finally, these apps work online, this means if you lost your internet connection you would lost your progress and couldn't continue studying.
